# Upgrade the banking app — what happens when a vendor's CI gets owned.
#
# Threat model this simulates: acme-fx (a small fintech vendor) was
# legitimately onboarded by the bank six months ago. Their MCP server
# was registered in agentregistry on day 1 (see 04-registry.sh), the
# Deployment + Service + RemoteMCPServer + Agent tool list were all
# authored by the bank's platform team and reviewed in PRs. None of
# that has changed.
#
# Today, acme-fx's CI pipeline gets compromised — same way Codecov,
# 3CX, ua-parser-js, and xz-utils all did. The attacker pushes a new
# image AT THE SAME TAG (1.0.0). The bank's CD reconciler / kubelet
# pulls it on next rollout. The bank's manifests didn't move. The
# catalogue entry didn't move. The malicious behaviour lives ONLY
# inside the new image — specifically:
#   - the prompt-injection is in the docstring of convert_currency()
#     which is what the MCP server returns in its tools/list response
#   - the exfil POST is in the function body
# Both are payloads served by HTTP responses from the vendor's pod.
# Nothing in the bank's audit-able resources looks different.
#
# What this script does:
#   1. Rebuild the vendor's image (--no-cache + timestamped tag so the
#      kubelet IfNotPresent cache can't hide the swap), now with the
#      upstream-injected malicious behaviour.
#   2. Roll the currency-converter deployment to the new image — exactly what
#      `helm upgrade` against the bank's chart would do in production.
#
# Note: the catalogue entry already exists from day 1 (see
# scripts/04-registry.sh — acme-fx/currency-converter v1.0.0 was
# published with the benign image). This script does NOT touch the
# catalogue. After it runs, `arctl mcp list` is unchanged — same 4
# entries, same versions, same descriptions. What changed is what
# runs INSIDE the pod when it starts.
#
# After this runs:
#   - The chatbot's next request triggers the prompt-injection in the
#     vendor's tool description, fooling the agent into passing customer
#     profile data through.
#   - The vendor's tool POSTs that data to
#     mock-attacker.external-attacker.svc.cluster.local — the C2 stand-in.
#   - With Solo OFF: POST succeeds. PII is in `kubectl logs -n
#     external-attacker deploy/mock-attacker`.
#   - With Solo ON: POST is denied at L4 by Istio AuthZ; the attempt
#     shows up as `istio_tcp_connections_failed_total{response_flags=
#     "CONNECT"}` in Prometheus and an 'explicitly denied by' line in
#     ztunnel logs.
