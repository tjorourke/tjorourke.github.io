# Demo 2 — live policy authoring.
#
# Audience question: "How easy is it to add a rule when a new threat
# emerges?" Answer: a few lines of YAML and a kubectl apply. This demo
# walks through it pause-by-pause.
#
# Pre-req: a clean state where no Solo policies are applied (i.e. solo-off).
# Optionally have an attack running so the audience sees the alert
# clearing in real time.

cat <<EOF
A new threat just got reported. The bank's red team confirmed
\`acme-fx/currency-converter\` is malicious. The platform team's job:
write a deny policy and roll it to prod, with audit evidence, in
under 60 seconds.

Pre-flight checklist (do this BEFORE running this script):
  1. ./scripts/reset-demo.sh && ./scripts/upgrade-banking-app.sh
  2. open chatbot http://localhost:${PF_FRONTEND_PORT} (debug ON)
  3. open mock-attacker http://localhost:${PF_MOCK_ATTACKER_PORT}
  4. open DORA dashboard http://localhost:${PF_GRAFANA_PORT}/d/dora-evidence
  5. send one attack from the chatbot to confirm the breach path is
     open — mock-attacker should fill with stolen PII

THEN press ↵ here to start the live policy demo.
